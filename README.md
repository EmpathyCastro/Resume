## Requirements

### Python

All python requirements are listed in requirements.txt. Run `python install -r requirements.txt` to install them all.

### CSS

Dart Sass is required to edit and compile Bootstrap CSS files. View download instructions [here](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).
Note: Dart SDK (required for Dart Sass) does not work for WSL. If using WSL, download the Windows version instead
and use the batch script provided. After installing Dart SDK, run `dart pub get`.

If using PyCharm, a Dart plugin is available that can download Dart SDK for you.

## Maintenance

Upgrading Dart SDK may be occasionally required. To do so on Windows, open a terminal in Administrator mode and run `choco upgrade dart-sdk`.
View [this page](https://dart.dev/get-dart#automated-installation-and-updates) for instructions on other platforms.

To edit Bootstrap CSS, view [this page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/) for detailed instructions on how to do so.
